# About me
Hi my name is Jakub and I am 24 years old. I graduated from the Cracow University of Economics with a degree in engineering, majoring in management and production engineering. I became interested in the subject of testing a few months before graduation. At that time I was gaining knowledge about manual testing of software and the necessary technical background. I decided to develop in this direction because I enjoy working on projects from a technical and quality perspective. I gain knowledge from courses, attending webinars on testing topics and testing on crowdtesting platforms. Working with data, documentation and a pro-quality approach is my forte. I am motivated and determined to self-develop and expand my qualifications.
